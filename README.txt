In order to use the program use either one of the following syntaxes:

./replaceinput.py [number]
EX: ./replaceinput.py 1

python3 replaceinput.py [number]
EX: python3 replaceinput.py 1

The data that is being copied must be in the data directory under the file path of ./data/[number].in
The program writes the data requested to the first .in file it finds
The data folder and b.in files are for testing the python3 program
